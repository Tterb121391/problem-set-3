    <h1>The Five Most Important Rules of Ultimate</h1>
    <p>Since Ultimate frisbee is a sport, it obviously has its own set of rules
    to make sure that the game stays somewhat orderly and doesn't get out of
    control. Here are the five most important tules of Ultimate listed from most
    important to least important:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Physical contact that affects the play is not allowed. A foul occurs
      when non-incidental physical contact occurs. Non-incidental contact means
      contact that has affected the play. Picks and screens are also considered
      fouls.</li>
      <li>A player is only allowed to pivot once while holding the disc. Moving
      the other foot that is supposed to be fixed is considered a travel and a
      foul.</li>
      <li>If a player has both feet out <em><strong>or</strong></em> one foot in
      and one foot out when he/she catches the disc, then the ruling is out, and
      it is a turnover.</li>
      <li>If a player catches the disc inbounds then runs out of bounds, then
      he/she must come back in and tap the disc on the ground to continue the
      play. If a player catches the disc and runs into the end zone, that is
      considered a walk-in, and the player must bring the disc back onto the end
      zone line and tap the disc on the ground to continue the play.</li>
      <li>If a foul is called and contested by the other player, then the
      previous play must be redone. Otherwise, if the foul was uncontested, then
      the play resumes as usual.</li>
    </ol>
