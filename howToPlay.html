    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>There are actually many different ways to play Ultimate frisbee, which
    depends on the environment and personal opnion. For example, if the field
    that you're going to play Ultimate firsbee on is too small for a regularly
    sized game, then you can play with smaller teams and smaller end zones.
    Since standard Ultimate frisbee fields are almost the size of a football
    field, variations are usually the way to go if you're playing a casual game
    of Ultimate firsbee with your friends.</p>
    <h2>The Standard Way to Play</h2>
    <p>In competitive Ultimate frisbee, the field is fourty yards wide and 120
    yards long, with the end zones on each side being 25 yards long each. When
    the game starts, each team puts a line of seven people on their respective
    end zone lines, and they decide who starts and offense and who starts on
    defense. When both lines are done planning, they will raise their arms up to
    show that they are ready, and the defense will start the point by throwing
    the disc down the field to the other line.</p>
    <h3>Offense</h3>
    <p>In Ultimate frisbee, offense and defense can switch especially quickly,
    and if you're not ready for it, you'll be caught off guard while trying to
    swtich mindsets and get scored on. The goal of offense is, obviously, to get
    the disc in the opposite end zone and score a point. This can be done by
    flowing the disc with multiple throws into the end zone, or someone can just
    huck a deep throw into the end zone and hope for the best. In offense, there
    are two main types of people:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Handlers: Handlers are the people who are mostly throwing to their
      teammates. They have the disc most of the time and are responsible for
      managing the disc and making sure the disc is not in an unfavorable spot.</li>
      <li>Cutters: Cutters are the people who are mostly catching the throws
      that handlers throw to them. They are running most of the time and have to
      try and get away from their defenders to be open for a throw.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Defense</h3>
    <p>The goal of defense is to prevent the offense from getting the disc into
    your end zone and scoring points. Usually, the denfense is man, which means
    that each person takes a man of similar size and speed. However, there is
    another type of defense called a zone, which is where three or four people
    are surrounding the person with the disc to make throwing much harder, and
    the rest try to block the potential deep throws and cutters.</p>
    <h2>Play Style Variations</h2>
